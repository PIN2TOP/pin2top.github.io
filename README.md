# PIN2TOP
## About

PIN2TOP is a free [AutoHotkey (AHK)](https://autohotkey.com/) script compiled to a tiny Windows executable. It is based on a very similar tool named "Always on Top" by Amit Agarwal, founder of the [Digital Inspiration](http://www.labnol.org/software/tutorials/keep-window-always-on-top/5213/) blog.
It has a new name, a more generic icon (to match the Windows 10 style better) and it doesn't limit itself to only a single line of code.
If you are curious what is in the script or if you want to build your own version check out the [uncompiled script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/PIN2TOP/pin2top.github.io/master/pin2top.ahk) - or go  straight to the [download](http://pin2top.github.io/pin2top.exe) section if not.
                

## Usage
First make sure **pin2top.exe** is running (start it manually or [add it to the startup folder](https://social.technet.microsoft.com/Forums/en-US/f0005629-0377-4e4b-82cc-26aff7b95884/how-do-you-add-new-startup-programs-in-wndows-10?forum=WinPreview2014General)), then select a window and hit **CTRL+SPACE** to keep it always on top. If you want to unpin a window just do it again or exit PIN2TOP via the tray icon.
